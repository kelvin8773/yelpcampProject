# YelpCamp Learning Project

YelpCamp project is a very popular Web Development Project in Udemy, it is published in 2015 while it still continually getting update until today!
It has a big community of students and course TA are very responses for your questions and problem.
The reason I put up this project here are:
1. For Self-learning and self-improvement.
2. To help others who have interest in learning full stack web development.
3. continually Improve this project to make it more close the real world project.


#### Learn Nodejs/Express/MongoDB Full Stack Web Development from Udemy.
